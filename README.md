# To run the project

**Install dependencies:** If you haven't already, install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

## Option 1

**Start the development server:** To start the Vite development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and provide you with a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) where you can access your application.

## Option 2

**Build for production:** When you're ready to build your application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of your application in the dist folder.

**Preview the production build:** After the build is complete, you can preview the production build by running:

```
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server (usually http://localhost:4173) and serve the production build, allowing you to test the final output.
